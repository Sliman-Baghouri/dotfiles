Hey there! üëã This is a collection of my personal dotfiles. here is where I fine-tune and tweak my Unix-like environment to suit my whims and fancies.

## Contents

Inside this digital treasure chest, you'll find a mishmash of configurations, a symphony of code that makes my command line sing and dance:

- **.dotfiles/**: Where the party starts. Dive in and explore the settings for all sorts of applications and tools.
- **.bashrc**: My trusty sidekick, guiding me through the maze of the Bash shell with its clever little tricks.
- **.nvim**: The maestro orchestrating the Vim text editor, ensuring every keystroke feels like a stroke of genius.
- **.gitconfig**: My wingman in the world of Git, keeping my commits in line and my branches in check.
- **.tmux.conf**: The conductor of my terminal symphony, bringing order to the chaos with its splits and panes.

## Usage

If you're feeling adventurous and want to join me on this journey:

1. **Clone the Repository** Fire up your terminal and let's get this show on the road:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   
2. **Create symbolic links using stow** Let's link these configurations to their rightful places. Head to .dotfiles directory and run:
   ```bash
   stow .

That's all, folks. Thanks for stopping by.
