# Dotfiles Arch Linux | Hyprland | Neovim | Kitty | Tmux

Hey there! 👋 This is a collection of my personal dotfiles. here is where I fine-tune and tweak my Unix-like environment to suit my whims and fancies.

## Contents

Inside this digital treasure chest, you'll find a mishmash of configurations, a symphony of code that makes my command line sing and dance:

- **.dotfiles/**: Where the party starts. Dive in and explore the settings for all sorts of applications and tools.
- **.bashrc**: My trusty sidekick, guiding me through the maze of the Bash shell with its clever little tricks.
- **.nvim**: The maestro orchestrating the Vim text editor, ensuring every keystroke feels like a stroke of genius.
- **.gitconfig**: My wingman in the world of Git, keeping my commits in line and my branches in check.
- **.tmux.conf**: The conductor of my terminal symphony, bringing order to the chaos with its splits and panes.
